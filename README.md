# Efficient Optimization using Fractional Knapsack

This project is a mini-project for the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab** at REVA University. It demonstrates a classic greedy algorithm implementation of the **Fractional Knapsack Problem**, which is a well-known resource optimization problem. The project is developed in **C programming language** with a focus on clarity, modularity, and efficiency.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To solve the Fractional Knapsack Problem using a greedy strategy that maximizes the total value of items in a knapsack of limited capacity, allowing partial selection of items based on their value-to-weight ratio.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Greedy algorithm implementation
- Modular code with comments
- Input-driven item list (values and weights)
- Real-time calculation of the optimal value
- Sorting based on value-to-weight ratio
- Fractional item selection for optimal solution
- Time Complexity: **O(n log n)** due to sorting
